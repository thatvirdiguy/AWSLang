# AWSLang

AWSLang is probablistic threat modeling and attack simulation language for the AWS environment. Based on [coreLang](https://github.com/pontusj101/coreLang), it is a domain specific language (DSL) created with [MAL (the Meta Attack Language](https://github.com/pontusj101/MAL).

**Note**: This was my master thesis project and is presented here as is, apart from a few convert-tab-to-space type changes to make it more readable. You can read the full report [here](https://kth.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?dswid=-6474&pid=diva2%3A1330746&c=3&searchType=SIMPLE&language=en&query=AWSLang&af=%5B%5D&aq=%5B%5B%5D%5D&aq2=%5B%5B%5D%5D&aqe=%5B%5D&noOfRows=50&sortOrder=author_sort_asc&sortOrder2=title_sort_asc&onlyFullText=false&sf=all). "AWSLang" was later rechristened as "awsLang", a new and improved version, that later became the foundation for [securiCAD Vanguard](https://foreseeti.com/securicad-vanguard-for-aws/). That new version should be preferred for basing off any further research, since we ended up not only covering a lot more AWS services, but also polishing things over for the new iteration.
